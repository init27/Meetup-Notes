#  About

This is a document to capture meeting notes and learnings from ChaiEDA Sessions, powered by [CTDS.Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRjtBP-o5FbgRzX2BHQEFtQ) and [MLT](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo).

These are 2xWeekly Meetups to learn EDA in a group and discuss our work together, as well as 2x Monthly challenges where we do EDA on a selected dataset that runs as an open task on Kaggle for 15 days.

At the end of the 15 days, the favourite kernel authors will be invited to present their work and if interested, broadcast via [CTDS YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRjtBP-o5FbgRzX2BHQEFtQ).
